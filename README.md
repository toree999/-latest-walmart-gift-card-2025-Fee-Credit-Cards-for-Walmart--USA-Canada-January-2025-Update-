The Walmart Rewards Mastercard
The Walmart Rewards World Mastercard
Both Walmart Canada credit cards are attractive, with no annual fee. With the World version, you get 3% cash back on your online purchases at Walmart.ca, which is hard to beat.Note that most credit cards consider Walmart – along with Costco – to be warehouse stores. As a result, the “for all purchases” earning rate will apply – not the accelerated grocery rate for a card like the American Express Cobalt Card, offering 5 points per dollar. At Walmart, it will, therefore, be only 1 point.

However, on the Mastercard side, some credit cards consider Walmart Supercentres like grocery stores.
